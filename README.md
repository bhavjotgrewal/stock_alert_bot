# in-stock-alert
A tool to determine if products are in stock.

# Why? #

During the current unprecedented situation, finding stock for GPUs, some CPUs, and consoles has been incredibly difficult. I wanted to help people find products they want and let them have a chance against bots and scalpers. Many people do not have the time to be at their computers all day, and this tool helps automate the process of finding stock. While there are stock livestreams available, this tool should be faster as it is run locally.
